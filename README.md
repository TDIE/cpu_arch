# Custom CPU Design
## Summary
This project's goal was to design and implement the micro-architecture and RTL for a simple, 16-bit, processor. Pre-Si verification was done by using the Universal Verification Method (UVM).
The CPU is capable of executing 18 instructions which include arithmetic, branches, and jumps. The RTL was written in Verilog. SystemVerilog was used to create the UVM verification IP.

## Scope and Schedule
The project was performed solely by the author so the scope had to be kept simple in order for the project to be completed in 1 to 2 quarters of after work hours. This means that some features were descoped in order to finish the project within this timeline. Physical implementation, e.g. in an FPGA, was also out of scope for this reason.

## Documentation Structure
The included design document has the following layout:
  1. Requirements and Specifications.
  2. Instruction Set Architecture
  3. Microarchitecture
  4. RTL Design
  5. Verification
  6. Future Imrpovements and Lessons Learned
